# Commit it

## Theme Song made by Bioblaze Payne for the Game Engine

[Verse 1]
Code it, test it, check it, merge it
Push it, pull it, fix it, deploy it
Branch it, stage it, squash it, build it
Tag it, sign it, clone it, ship it

[Verse 2]
Review it, lint it, debug it, run it
Fetch it, commit it, log it, stash it
Fork it, sync it, rebase it, roll it
Patch it, track it, resolve it, seal it

[Chorus]
Code it, test it, check it, merge it
(Commit it!)
Code it, test it, check it, merge it
(Commit it!)
Push it, pull it, fix it, deploy it
(Ship it!)
Code it, test it, check it, merge it
(Commit it!)

[Verse 3]
PR it, clone it, configure it, deploy it
Cherry-pick it, rebase it, update it, log it
Commit it, rollback it, review it, tag it
Hotfix it, fork it, restart it, close it

[Bridge]
Squash it, resolve it, clean it, pull it
Patch it, check it, compile it, run it
Merge it, test it, finalize it, ship it
Track it, close it, deploy it, done it

[Chorus]
Code it, test it, check it, merge it
(Commit it!)
Code it, test it, check it, merge it
(Commit it!)
Push it, pull it, fix it, deploy it
(Ship it!)
Code it, test it, check it, merge it
(Commit it!)
